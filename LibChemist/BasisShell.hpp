/** \brief Class for holding the details of a basis set.
 *
 *  This class is meant to hold the information relating to a particular basis
 *  set shell.  It does not hold the center's location, but rather the exponents
 *  and coefficients.  These values live within this class and are thus not
 *  aliases or pointers to a contigious buffer.  When a user requests a BasisSet
 *  instance from a molecule the exponents and coefficients will be put into a
 *  contigious buffer.
 *
 *  \note This class is aware of general contractions.  What this means is
 *  rather than thinking of this as being the exponents and coefficients for
 *  \f$n\f$ contractions where \f$n\f$ is the number of primitive functions this
 *  class is actually \f$n\f$ exponents and \f$m\f$ rows of \f$n\f$ coefficients
 *  where \f$m\f$ is the number of contractions in the instance.  The main place
 *  this will get you is if your basis set has an "sp", "spd", etc. shell.
 *  These are examples of general contractions, but most codes expect the
 *  shells to be uncompressed. That can be done at the molecule level.
