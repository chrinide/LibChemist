/** \brief This is the main class for storing the atoms in our system.
 *
 * \note This is the class most chemists would call Molecule, but apparently
 * calling something a molecule is a sore spot for other disciplines...
 *
 * \note This class is basically an ordered set.  Unfortunately the STL doesn't
 * implement such a class.  If an ordered set class is ever made (either by the
 * STL or this project) it makes sense to typedef ordered_set<Atoms> to
 * SetOfAtoms.
 *
 * \note By making Atom hashable and storing an unordered_map<Atom,size_t> where
 * size_t is the index assigned to Atom this class could be sped up if need be.
 *
 * This class is bare bones in the sense that this class does not know anything
 * about bonds, angles, etc. It is basically a typedef of std::set<Atom> with
 * some syntactic sugar related to combining instances.  One can build these
 * higher-level constructs using the public API of the class.
 *
 * Design details:
 *
 * When designing this class we were guided by the following:
 *
 * 1. Most codes will use this class is to obtain the basis set, charge,
 *    multiplicity, and nothing else.
 * 2. The remaining codes will need to build molecules up by adding/subtracting
 *    atoms.
 * 3. It does not make sense for SetOfAtoms to contain two copies of exactly the
 *    same atom (note same is not just the same place in space, but same basis,
 *    same mass, etc.)
 *
 * Implementation details:
 *
 *
 * Despite appearing to the outside world as if the atoms are stored in a set,
 * they are really stored in an std::vector.  This is because it
 * is my experience that users feel they are entitled to refer to atoms in the
 * order they provided, i.e. if an atom is the second atom in the input file it
 * should forever be obtainable by requesting atom 1 (the first being atom 0).
 * std::set would reorder the atoms.  A secondary reason is that we need an
 * order to our atoms, it is not sufficient to use a non-random iterator in all
 * cases (mainly when mapping atoms to elements of tensors).  Rather than having
 * to call std::advance to get the i-th element of the std::set we can simply
 * use std::vector's index operator.
