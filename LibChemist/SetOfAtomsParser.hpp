/** \file This file contains the machinery for parsing a string representation
 *  of a set of atoms.
 *
 * Unfortunately, like basis sets, there are a plethora of formats for
 * representing collections of atoms.  We again break the parsing into two
 * phases an examination of the line, and a data obtaining phase.  For the
 * former phase we have the following actions:
 * - none: the line is not worth parsing
 * - new_atom: the line contains information for a new atom
 * - same_atom: the line contains information for the current atom
 * - overall_system: the line contains information for the overall system
 *
 * If your parser signals the line is worth parsing you will be given the line
 * again and this time you will need to return the data the line contains. The
 * choices at the moment are:
 * - AtNum: the atomic number of the atom
 * - x: the x-coordinate of the atom (you are expected to ensure it is in a.u.
 * - y: same as x except for the y-coordinate
 * - z: same as x and y except for the z-coordinate
 * - charge: the overall system charge
 * - multiplicity: the overall system multiplicity
 *
 * \TODO The following data pieces will be needed eventually, but have not been
 * coded up:
 * - q: the charge of a point charge
 * - point: a dummy atom
 * - ghost: a ghost atom
 * - UCSides: the sides of the unit cell
 * - UCAngles: the angles of the unit cell
 * - SpaceGroup: which space group the unit cell belongs to.
